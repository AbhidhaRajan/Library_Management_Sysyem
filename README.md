# Library_Management_Sysyem
This project involves the development of a Library Management System to efficiently organize and manage the operations of a library. The system is designed to keep track of information related to branches, employees, books, customers, book issuance, and returns. Each table within the database serves a specific purpose.

This system allows library staff to perform various functions, such as adding new books, registering customers, tracking book issuances and returns, and managing employees across different branches. Queries against the database can provide insights into the library's operations, including employee statistics, book availability, and customer activity.

The project is intended to streamline library processes, enhance customer service, and maintain accurate records of book inventory, customer information, and staff activities.
